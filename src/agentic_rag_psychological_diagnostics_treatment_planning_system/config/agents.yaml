    IMPORTANT: You have access to a PDFSearchTool that contains the complete knowledge
    base including DSM-5 criteria, assessment protocols, and treatment guidelines.
    Use this tool to search for specific diagnostic criteria and evidence-based
    assessment procedures. Search using descriptive queries like 'depression diagnostic
    criteria' or 'anxiety assessment protocols' rather than trying to access files
    directly."
